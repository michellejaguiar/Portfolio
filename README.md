# Data Portfolio

Welcome to my analytics portfolio. This collection showcases end-to-end projects that combine exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, data visualization, and business insight. Each project was completed using real-world datasets and includes documentation of methodology, tools, and actionable outcomes.

## Dognition | SQL

### Dognition Engagement Analysis 
**Tools:** MySQL, Jupyter Notebook  
**Goal:** Uncover test engagement trends and user behavior across geography and time.  
**Highlights:**  
- Cleaned and filtered over 950K records for valid engagement  
- Identified Sunday and Monday as peak test activity days  
- Confirmed time zone robustness after UTC-to-Central adjustment  
- California, New York, and Texas ranked highest for user activity

## Waze | Python

### Waze User Churn ‚Äì Exploratory Analysis  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, Jupyter Notebook  
**Goal:** Identify behavioral signals that differentiate churned and retained users.  
**Highlights:**  
- Assessed data completeness and class imbalance  
- Calculated engagement metrics  
- Discovered that churned users exhibit high-intensity, short-term usage  
- iPhone vs Android users showed no churn difference

### Waze Churn Prediction ‚Äì Logistic Regression  
**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib  
**Goal:** Build an interpretable churn prediction model.  
**Highlights:**  
- Applied logistic regression with variable scaling and encoding  
- Validated assumptions and analyzed model coefficients  
- Achieved 82.4% accuracy, but low recall (9%)  
- Identified ‚Äúprofessional drivers‚Äù as least likely to churn

## Lightning Strikes | Tableau

### U.S. Lightning Strikes ‚Äì Tableau Visualization  
**Tools:** Tableau  
**Goal:** Explore geographic and temporal patterns of lightning activity.  
**Highlights:**  
- Built interactive map and time series dashboard  
- Found 48% increase in total strikes over 10 years  
- Identified Texas and Oklahoma as top strike zones  
- Revealed westward geographic shift in lightning clusters

### Lightning Strike Metrics Dashboard  
**Tools:** Tableau  
**Goal:** Build an interactive, user-friendly tool to analyze lightning intensity.  
**Highlights:**  
- Visualized per-location strike intensity and averages  
- Filtered by year for temporal comparison  
- Highest individual point recorded: 2,211 strikes  
- Added location click features for regional insights
